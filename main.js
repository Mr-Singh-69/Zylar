        **Ploughing**: Our Ploughing Mechanism will plough the field when you tell it to. It consists of one Servo Motor and is connected with the Arduino Uno.
    
        **Seed Sowing Mechanism**: It will sow seeds automatically when required in the field. It consists of a Servo Motor and a creative Bottle System idea invented by the team.
    
        **Soil Moisture**: It will automatically give water to the field when required. The flow of water can be controlled. It consists of a Soil Moisture Sensor, Arduino Nano, and a Breadboard.
    
        **Grass Cutter**: It will cut the grass of the field when required. It is controlled by a DC Motor and Arduino Nano.
    
        **Stone Remover**: It will remove stones located on the particular land. It is controlled by a DC Motor.
    
        **Future Possibilities**:
        - Smart AI-powered robots that can fully operate and manage the farm.
        - Systems that provide water to the soil when needed automatically.
        - Robots that detect animals or birds in the fields and buzz a siren to scare them away.
        - Robots that detect the nutrients present in the soil and suggest which crops can be grown (not in our robot yet, but we aim to add it).`);
